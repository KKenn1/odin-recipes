            Saigon Noodle Salad is a refreshing and vibrant Vietnamese dish that combines rice noodles, fresh vegetables, herbs, and grilled meat or tofu. The salad is typically dressed with a tangy and slightly sweet dressing made from fish sauce, lime juice, garlic, and chili. This salad is perfect for hot summer days as it is light, healthy, and packed with flavors. It can be served as a main course or as a side dish, and is a great option for those looking for a gluten-free or vegetarian meal.
